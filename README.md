# guessing-game2

This time you are able to choos the number range in which you would like the program to pick one number from, then you can see how long it takes to guess the correct number. 

This will require you to run it on your michene and not a web browser because it uses the sys module. 

Clone repo, enter project folder via terminal, run ~ python3 g2.py num1 num2 ~ press enter and your michene will ask you to guess a number... Good Luck!
